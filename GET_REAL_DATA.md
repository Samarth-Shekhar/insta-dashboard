## ⚠️ IMPORTANT:

### The Extension Panel MUST Appear
If you don't see the panel on the left side of Instagram:
- The extension isn't working
- You need to reload it
- You might be on the wrong page

### You MUST Click "START SCRAPING"
The extension doesn't scrape automatically. You have to:
1. See the panel
2. Click the button
3. Wait for it to finish

### You MUST Be on a Hashtag Page
The extension only works on:
- ✅ `https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/HASHTAG/`
- ❌ NOT on profiles, feed, reels, etc.

**Solution:**
1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Reload the extension
3. Refresh Instagram page
4. Look again on the left side

### Problem: Scraping fails

1. Check if backend is running (should be)
2. Check console for errors (F12)
3. Try a different hashtag (#dog, #food)

1. Make sure you got the success alert
